# handlebars-to-jsx

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This is a fork of [handlebars-to-jsx](https://github.com/danakt/handlebars-to-jsx) since the
npm package for that library is not valid, and it does not seem to be maintained.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test handlebars-to-jsx` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
